## Features
<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `todo DESCRIPTION`, `DESCRIPTION` is a parameter which can be used as `todo borrow book`.

* `DATE` must always be in the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm`.
  e.g. in `deadline DESCRIPTION /by DATE`, it should be `deadline return book /by 2024-11-23 12:00`.

* Parameters must be in the specified order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `DESCRIPTION from/DATE`, it needs to follow this format strictly.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
